# Project: Financial Transactions Data Pipeline with DBT, BigQuery/Snowflake & API Ingestion
Goal:
Build an end-to-end ELT pipeline that extracts financial transaction data from an API, loads it into a data warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake), and transforms it into analytics-ready tables using DBT.



For this project, we'll use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or AWS S3 before loading data into BigQuery/Snowflake.

2️⃣ Orchestration Tool for Automation
To orchestrate the pipeline, use Apache Airflow (widely used in fintech and big data teams).
Airflow automates tasks like:
✅ Extracting data from the API on a schedule
✅ Uploading raw data to cloud storage
✅ Loading data into BigQuery/Snowflake
✅ Triggering DBT transformations

Updated Step-by-Step Plan (With Storage & Orchestration)
# ```DONE!``` Step 1: Set Up Your Environment ```DONE!```
✅ Use GitHub Codespaces for development
✅ Install required libraries:

```bash```
Copy
Edit
```bash
pip install requests pandas dbt-bigquery google-cloud-bigquery apache-airflow
```

For AWS (S3, Redshift, Snowflake):
```bash```
Copy
Edit
```bash
pip install boto3 snowflake-connector-python dbt-snowflake
```

# Step 2: Extract & Store Raw Data
✅ Extract Data from API & Store in Cloud (GCS/S3) Modify the Python script to first save raw JSON data in cloud storage.

For Google Cloud Storage (GCS):

```python```
Copy
Edit
```python
from google.cloud import storage
import requests
import pandas as pd
import json

# Fetch API Data
API_URL = "https://api.example.com/transactions"
response = requests.get(API_URL, headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"})
data = response.json()

# Save as JSON
file_name = "transactions_raw.json"
with open(file_name, "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Upload to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.bucket("your-bucket-name")
blob = bucket.blob(file_name)
blob.upload_from_filename(file_name)

print(f"Uploaded {file_name} to GCS")
```


✅ For AWS S3 (if using Redshift/Snowflake instead of BigQuery):

```python```
Copy
Edit
```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3")
s3.upload_file("transactions_raw.json", "your-s3-bucket", "transactions_raw.json")
print("Uploaded to S3")
```


# Step 3: Load Data from Storage into Data Warehouse
Once data is stored in GCS/S3, load it into BigQuery/Snowflake.

✅ For BigQuery:

```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE finance.transactions_raw AS
SELECT * FROM `your_bucket.transactions_raw.json`;
```

✅ For Snowflake (from S3):

```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE transactions_raw (
    id INT,
    amount FLOAT,
    date DATE,
    category STRING
);
COPY INTO transactions_raw FROM @your_s3_stage;
```

# Step 4: Transform Data Using DBT
✅ Configure DBT to Connect to BigQuery or Snowflake Modify profiles.yml inside your DBT project.

For BigQuery (```~/.dbt/profiles.yml```):

```yaml```
Copy
Edit
```yaml
finance_project:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: your-gcp-project-id
      dataset: finance
      threads: 4
      location: US
  target: dev
```

For Snowflake (```~/.dbt/profiles.yml```):

```yaml```
Copy
Edit
```yaml
finance_project:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: your_snowflake_account
      user: your_username
      password: your_password
      role: your_role
      database: FINANCE
      warehouse: COMPUTE_WH
      schema: PUBLIC
  target: dev
```

✅ Run DBT Models

```bash```
Copy
Edit
```python
dbt run
dbt test
```

# Step 5: Automate the Pipeline with Airflow
✅ Install Airflow in GitHub Codespaces:

```bash```
Copy
Edit
```python
pip install apache-airflow apache-airflow-providers-google apache-airflow-providers-amazon
```

✅ Create an Airflow DAG (airflow_dags/elt_pipeline.py)

```python```
Copy
Edit
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.local_to_gcs import LocalFilesystemToGCSOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryInsertJobOperator
from datetime import datetime
import requests
import json

default_args = {"owner": "airflow", "start_date": datetime(2024, 1, 1)}

def extract_api_data():
    API_URL = "https://api.example.com/transactions"
    response = requests.get(API_URL, headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"})
    with open("/tmp/transactions_raw.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(response.json(), f)

with DAG("elt_pipeline", default_args=default_args, schedule_interval="@daily", catchup=False) as dag:
    
    extract_data = PythonOperator(
        task_id="extract_data",
        python_callable=extract_api_data,
    )

    upload_to_gcs = LocalFilesystemToGCSOperator(
        task_id="upload_to_gcs",
        src="/tmp/transactions_raw.json",
        dst="transactions_raw.json",
        bucket="your-bucket-name",
        mime_type="application/json"
    )

    load_to_bigquery = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(
        task_id="load_to_bigquery",
        configuration={
            "query": {
                "query": "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE finance.transactions_raw AS SELECT * FROM `your_bucket.transactions_raw.json`;",
                "useLegacySql": False,
            }
        }
    )

    extract_data >> upload_to_gcs >> load_to_bigquery
```

✅ Run Airflow DAG:

```bash```
Copy
Edit
```python
airflow standalone
```

Realism & Industry Relevance
This project mimics real-world analytics engineering work because:

You’re working with real APIs, not static CSVs.
You’re storing data in a cloud warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake).
You’re using DBT for scalable transformations.
You can extend it with CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automation.




# 🔹 Additional Major Aspects in Analytics Engineering
## 1️⃣ Data Modeling (Beyond Just Staging & Marts in DBT)
✅ Use Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema) to structure the data warehouse properly.
✅ Create fact tables (e.g., fact_transactions) and dimension tables (e.g., dim_customers).
✅ Ensure slowly changing dimensions (SCD) are handled correctly in DBT.

Example: Instead of just loading raw transactions, design a star schema for better reporting.

## 2️⃣ Data Quality & Testing (Critical for Analytics Engineers!)
✅ Implement DBT tests for data integrity, null values, uniqueness, and referential integrity.
✅ Set up automated validation checks (e.g., "Are transaction amounts ever negative?").
✅ Introduce alerting (via Airflow or Slack notifications) when tests fail.

Example: If transaction IDs aren’t unique, DBT should fail the pipeline and notify engineers.

## 3️⃣ Version Control & CI/CD for Data Pipelines
✅ Store all DBT models, SQL queries, and pipeline scripts in GitHub.
✅ Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy DBT changes.
✅ Test transformations before merging to production.

Example: Every time a new DBT model is added, GitHub runs automated DBT tests before deploying.

## 4️⃣ Data Orchestration Beyond Just Airflow
✅ Consider dbt Cloud or Dagster instead of Apache Airflow for scheduling.
✅ If using Airflow, leverage task dependencies and retries for better resilience.

Example: If an API call fails, Airflow retries 3 times before failing the DAG.

## 5️⃣ Cost Optimization (Essential in Cloud Data Warehouses!)
✅ Use partitioning & clustering in BigQuery/Snowflake to reduce costs.
✅ Optimize SQL queries to minimize expensive scans.
✅ Set up budget alerts on cloud storage and compute costs.

Example: Instead of scanning an entire transactions table daily, partition by date for cost savings.

## 6️⃣ Data Governance & Access Control
✅ Set up role-based access control (RBAC) in BigQuery/Snowflake.
✅ Implement data encryption and masking for sensitive data (e.g., customer details).
✅ Track data lineage so analysts understand where data comes from.

Example: Only the Finance Team should have access to customer salary details in reports.

📌 Final Thoughts:
You've already got a solid pipeline plan, but adding:
✔️ Data modeling
✔️ Testing & monitoring
✔️ Version control & CI/CD
✔️ Cost optimizations
✔️ Data governance



## 2️⃣ Adjusted CI/CD Workflow for Snowflake
Since you’re using Snowflake, we’ll make the following adjustments:

✅ Replace dbt-bigquery with dbt-snowflake.
✅ Use Snowflake's warehouse optimizations (clustering, auto-suspend, etc.).
✅ Deploy DBT models into Snowflake instead of BigQuery.

🚀 Step-by-Step Snowflake CI/CD Workflow
## 🔹 Step 1: Set Up Your Snowflake Environment
Create a Snowflake account (free-tier available).
Create a database & warehouse:
```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
CREATE DATABASE analytics_db;
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh;
```
Create a Snowflake role & user (for dbt):
```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
CREATE ROLE dbt_role;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE analytics_db TO ROLE dbt_role;
CREATE USER dbt_user PASSWORD = 'your_password' DEFAULT_ROLE = dbt_role;
GRANT ROLE dbt_role TO USER dbt_user;
```

🔹 Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with Snowflake
📌 Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/dbt_snowflake.yml.

✅ This workflow will:
✔️ Test your DBT models using Snowflake.
✔️ Deploy changes automatically if tests pass.

```yaml```
Copy
Edit
```yaml
name: DBT CI/CD Pipeline (Snowflake)

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install dbt-snowflake sqlfluff

      - name: Lint SQL with SQLFluff
        run: sqlfluff lint models/

      - name: Run DBT Tests on Snowflake
        env:
          SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT }}
          SNOWFLAKE_USER: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_USER }}
          SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD }}
          SNOWFLAKE_ROLE: dbt_role
          SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE: analytics_db
          SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE: analytics_wh
        run: |
          dbt test --profiles-dir .

      - name: Deploy DBT Models to Snowflake (if tests pass)
        run: dbt run --profiles-dir .
```
## 🔹 Step 3: Automate Airflow DAGs for Snowflake
If you're using Airflow for orchestration:
✔️ Write an Airflow DAG that triggers your DBT run.
✔️ Store the DAGs in GitHub and deploy them automatically.

Example Airflow DAG for Snowflake & DBT:

```python```
Copy
Edit
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1
}

dag = DAG('dbt_snowflake_pipeline', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily')

run_dbt = BashOperator(
    task_id='run_dbt',
    bash_command='dbt run --profiles-dir .',
    dag=dag
)

run_dbt
```
✔️ This ensures your DBT models run daily in Snowflake.

## 🔹 Step 4: Optimize Snowflake for Performance & Cost
To avoid unnecessary compute costs, implement:

✅ Auto-Suspend Compute (to avoid charges when not in use):

```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 300;
```
✅ Clustering for Faster Queries:

```sql```
Copy
Edit
```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions CLUSTER BY (transaction_date);
```
✅ Use Snowflake Streams for Incremental Loading (instead of full refreshes).

🚀 Final Steps & Next Actions
✅ Set up Snowflake, GitHub Actions, and Airflow.
✅ Push your DBT models to Snowflake.
✅ Ensure CI/CD workflow is running smoothly.
✅ Test & optimize queries to reduce costs.
